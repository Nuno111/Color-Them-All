## About the game

* The objective of this game is to click inside all the moving circles consecutively without missing any clicks.

* There are X number of clicks limits allowed, once you run out of clicks it's game over.

* Successfully clicking on a circle will change its colour, once all circles are the same colour, you go to the next level.

* Each level the difficulty increases, by increasing the number of circles, increasing the speed of the circles and making the circles smaller.

* "Snitch Circle" - Similar to harry potter snitch, a high speed, small size circle that has a win condition.
